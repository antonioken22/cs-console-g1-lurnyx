## Prerequisites Before Running Locally

Install the following into your own computer:

1.  [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2.  [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

## Running Locally

1.  Clone this repository into your computer.

2.  Navigate to the project's root directory.

3.  Run the application from your terminal.

    ```cmd
    dotnet run --project Group1Lurnyx
    ```

    > _Note: When you run this command, you are telling the dotnet tool to look inside the `Group1Lurnyx` folder. From there, it searches for a single project file (a file ending in .csproj). And then runs that specific project._
